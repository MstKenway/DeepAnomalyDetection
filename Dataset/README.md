# Dataset

## Explaination
There are three datasets here. Two raw datasets and one preprocessed dataset. Raw datasets are collected from BM without any processing. Timestamps are compounded and detailed labels are added in the preprocessed dataset and data are stored in decimal instead of hex.

1. raw_log_normal_data.csv is an attack-free raw dataset. Download from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/14x6ri88xb8pvgg/raw_log_normal_data.csv?dl=0)
2. raw_log_with_attacks.csv is a raw dataset with 3 kinds of attack, namely replay, forgery and dos. Download from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eamzqrxc4bmdt96/raw_log_with_attacks.csv?dl=0)
3. dataset_after_preprocess.csv is the preprocessed one of raw_log_with_attacks.csv. Download from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gq18c5gvhq4heqj/dataset_after_preprocess.csv?dl=0)
